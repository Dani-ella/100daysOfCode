Hi! I am Daniella Afriyie Asare, an aspiring bioengineer and an IT enthusiast.
I look forward to making the most out of this opportunity.
I am new to GitHub but following instructions given, i must say I am making some progress.
In the days to come, i look forward to spending 2 hours each day learning to be a better programmer.
I intend on working within the hours of 12am to 2am.
I expect to have learnt a lot and be able to make some really cool projects from the skill acquired.
I love to play table tennis, swim and hang out with friends...yh •|•
